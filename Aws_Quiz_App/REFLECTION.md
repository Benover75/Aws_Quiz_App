# Project Reflection: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Quiz

## Development Process
This project was built as a single-page web application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create an engaging, accessible, and visually appealing quiz tool for AWS exam preparation, with no dependencies or build steps required.

## Design Choices
- **Single HTML File:** All code (logic, styles, questions) is contained in `index.html` for simplicity and portability.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Gradient backgrounds, animated elements (rocket, confetti, fireworks), and responsive design enhance user engagement.
- **Accessibility:** High contrast mode, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation ensure usability for all users.
- **Persistence:** Quiz progress is saved in localStorage, allowing users to resume where they left off.
- **Review Features:** Users can review incorrect answers and see a detailed summary at the end, supporting learning and self-assessment.

## Challenges
- Balancing feature richness with code simplicity in a single file.
- Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
- Managing quiz state, progress, and review logic without external libraries.

## Potential Improvements
- Add more certification levels and question pools.
- Support importing/exporting custom question sets.
- Add user authentication for tracking progress across devices.
- Integrate with AWS services for real-time updates or analytics.
- Improve question randomization and adaptive difficulty.
- Add audio/visual feedback for accessibility.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a feature-rich, interactive quiz app can be built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a useful tool for AWS exam practice and as a template for similar educational apps.
